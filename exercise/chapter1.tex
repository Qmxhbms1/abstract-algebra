% Problem 1.1
\begin{problem}
  Show that every group of order $\le 5$ is abelian.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  The trivial group is vacously abelian.
  We know from Proposition 2.2 that the order of every element of the group must divide the order of the group, since $\{e\}$ is a group and the singleton containing any set is a coset of it.
  For the prime orders, $2, 3, 5$, this implies that any element either has order $1$ or $5$.
  If a group of order $p$ has an element of order $p$ it must be a cyclic group generated by that element, and all cyclic groups are abelian since $x^p$ = $x^i x^j$ for any $i + j = p$.
  The groups of order $4$ can have elements whose order is either $1, 2$ or $4$.
  If it has an element of order $4$ it is cyclic and we are done.
  Otherwise, the only element or order $1$ is the identity by definition, hence there are three elements of order $2$, call them $a, b, c$.
  We know that $ab = c$ and $ba = c$, otherwise we could use the cancelation laws to see that one of $a, b, c$ is the identity.
  Since the same argument can be used for $ac, ca$ and $bc, cb$ the group must be abelian and we are done.
\end{solution}

% Problem 1.2
\begin{problem}
  Show that there are two non-isomorphic groups of order $4$, namely the cyclic one, and the product of two cyclic groups of order 2.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  As shown above, a group of order $4$ either has an element of order $4$, in which case it is abelian, or it has the identity and three elements of order $2$, and is unique up to isomorphism.
  It is simple to write out the product of two cyclic groups of order $2$ and confirm that it gives us the identity and three elements of order $2$.
  Take $G = \{1, a\}$ and $H = \{1, b\}$.
  Their product is $GH = \{(1, 1), (1, b), (a, 1), (a, b)\}$, and since $a^2 = 1$ and $b^2 = 1$ it clearly follows that $(1, b)^2 = (a, 1)^2 = (a, b)^2 = (1, 1)$.
\end{solution}

% Problem 1.3
\begin{problem}
  Let $G$ be a group.
  A commutator in $G$ is an element of the form $aba^{-1}b^{-1}$ with $a, b \in G$.
  Let $G^c$ be the subgroup generated by the commutators.
  Then $G^c$ is called the commutator subgroup.
  Show that $G^c$ is normal.
  Show that any homomorphism of $G$ into an abelian group factors through $G/G^c$.
\end{problem}
